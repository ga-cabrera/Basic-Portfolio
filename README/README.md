# Basic-Portfolio
Created a simple portfolio website that consists of an "about me", a contact and a portfolio page. It's not much, but it gets the job done.

It's a small feature, but I'm proud of the glow around the navbar buttons when you hover over them. 

The portfolio page is my biggest challenge yet, but it will be the best darn thing a noob like me has ever coded in his entire life.

the contact page was simple, mostly because I used a "stencil" and made it my own. but it definitely works I wanted it to.

Photos aren't in the equation yet, but they will turn up soon.

I'll be updating this website as the months go by. I'll keep you updated!

<UPDATE> 7.28.2019

page has been completed. All photos have been added to the webpage and portfolio page has been fixed. Now all photo headers are in front of photos, just as planned.
